Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains the implementation of popular data structures and algorithms. The following algorithms and data structures have been implemented so far.

Algorithms:
Binary Search Algorithm: This algorithm searches for a target element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log n).

Bubble Sort Algorithm: This is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2).

Depth First Search:
Depth first search is a classic algorithm used for traversing a graph or tree structure, and this project implements both the iterative and recursive versions of the algorithm in Java. The iterative version uses a stack to keep track of visited nodes, while the recursive version uses the call stack to traverse the tree or graph.

Breadth First Search:
Breath First Search is another graph traversal algorithm, which explores all the nodes at the current depth before moving on to the next level of nodes. This implementation of breath first search in Java is also included in the project.

Data Structures:
Linked List: A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are stored in a node, which contains a data field and a reference to the next node in the list. The time complexity of accessing an element in a linked list is O(n).

Stacks: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. The main operations in a stack are push (inserting an element at the top of the stack) and pop (removing the top element from the stack). The time complexity of these operations is O(1).

Queues: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. The main operations in a queue are enqueue (inserting an element at the end of the queue) and dequeue (removing the first element from the queue). The time complexity of these operations is O(1).

HashMap:
A hash map is a data structure that allows for efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs, by using a hash function to map the key to an index in an array. The hash map implementation in this project uses chaining to handle collisions, and includes functions for adding, retrieving, and removing elements from the map. Overall, these projects showcase fundamental algorithms and data structures that are important for any programmer to understand and apply in their code.
