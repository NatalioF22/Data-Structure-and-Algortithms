Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains the implementation of popular data structures and algorithms. The following algorithms and data structures have been implemented so far.

Algorithms:
Binary Search Algorithm: This algorithm searches for a target element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log n).

Bubble Sort Algorithm: This is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n^2).

Data Structures:
Linked List: A linked list is a linear data structure in which elements are stored in a node, which contains a data field and a reference to the next node in the list. The time complexity of accessing an element in a linked list is O(n).

Stacks: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. The main operations in a stack are push (inserting an element at the top of the stack) and pop (removing the top element from the stack). The time complexity of these operations is O(1).

Queues: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. The main operations in a queue are enqueue (inserting an element at the end of the queue) and dequeue (removing the first element from the queue). The time complexity of these operations is O(1).
